# Welcome.

I wanted to investigate what static site creators were around, and a guy from work put me on to Hugo.

I'm seriously impressed with the ease of the workflow and getting it setup so I think I'll be learning a lot more about Hugo.  Using markdown to create web content is so easy what with Atom and a few plugins I'm laughing! Up and running in moments rather than days - plus Apache can be a very basic setup as the content generated is simple static web stuff, none of the associated vulnerabilities of other frameworks.

All in all I recommend you check it out [Go Hugo!](http://gohugo.io)
